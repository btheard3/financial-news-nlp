# Market NLP Intelligence

This project explores whether **market-related text** (news, commentary, trade rationales)
contains predictive signal for future market behavior.

The goal is to transform unstructured financial language into
quantitative features and evaluate their relationship to price direction
and volatility.

This repository contains:
- exploratory notebooks
- NLP feature engineering
- predictive modeling
