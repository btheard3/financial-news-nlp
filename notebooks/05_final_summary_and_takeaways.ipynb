    "but also by narratives conveyed through news and media.\n",

    "**Can natural language processing uncover recurring market narratives\n",
    "from financial news headlines, and do different news sources emphasize\n",

    "- **The Guardian** — broader economic and political framing\n",

    "\n",
    "The analysis followed a structured NLP pipeline:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**\n",
    "   - inspected schema and source balance\n",
    "   - identified headline text as the core NLP input\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Text Cleaning & Normalization**\n",
    "   - standardized casing and punctuation\n",
    "   - removed noise (URLs, duplicates)\n",
    "   - produced a reusable cleaned dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Baseline Clustering (TF-IDF + KMeans)**\n",
    "   - converted text to interpretable numerical features\n",
    "   - identified coarse thematic groupings\n",
    "   - compared themes across sources\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Topic Modeling (LDA)**\n",
    "   - extracted dominant narrative themes\n",
    "   - validated topics using real headline examples\n",
    "   - measured narrative emphasis by source"

    "Several clear and interpretable market narratives emerged:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Macro Economy & COVID Impact**\n",
    "  Headlines focused on economic growth, layoffs, and global disruption,\n",
    "  particularly during periods of uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Crisis, Brexit & Financial Stability**\n",
    "  UK- and Europe-focused reporting emphasized institutional stress,\n",
    "  banking exposure, and policy uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Market Commentary & Stock Picks**\n",
    "  CNBC headlines clustered around analyst opinions, earnings reactions,\n",
    "  and stock-level recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Big Tech, IPOs & Corporate Deals**\n",
    "  Large-cap technology firms, IPO activity, and mergers formed a\n",

    "Topic distributions differed meaningfully across news sources,\n",

    "- TF-IDF provided a strong, interpretable baseline for clustering\n",

    "- Headlines are short and lack full article context\n",

    "- analyzing full article text instead of headlines\n",

    "- aligning narratives with market volatility or returns\n",
    "- building a lightweight dashboard for narrative exploration\n",
